# captions

This is a simple script to convert captions generated by Zoom in WEBVTT format to the SRT format needed by Drexel Streams.

Some capabilities:

* can read a sequence of VTT files in to generate a single, correctly spliced SRT output file
* allows addition of interval at the beginning of each input file
* removes speaker name (me)
